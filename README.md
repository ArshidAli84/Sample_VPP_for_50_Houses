# Sample_VPP_for_50_Houses
The provided Python code simulates a virtual power plant managing energy for 50 houses, integrating a solar plant with a 250 kWh capacity for both peak and off-peak hours. The program employs a rule-based strategy to optimize energy distribution, using battery storage to bridge demand shortfalls. Load-shifting techniques are applied during off-peak hours, and a visualization illustrates energy consumption, solar generation, and load shifting. The resulting model promotes sustainable energy management and minimizes load shedding through intelligent utilization of solar resources and storage capabilities.
